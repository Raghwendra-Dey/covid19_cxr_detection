This is an open ended project to provide DL based solutions. 

Task: Develop a DL based model to solve the COVID19Action-Radiology-CXR https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/covid19action-radiology-cxr 

Submit: Notebook with executed solution on Pytorch, clearly indicating through comments and explained text/header in the .ipynb, detailing

1.  have you taken any methods to compensate for class imbalance?
2.  any conditions of hot restart during training?
3.  present the training/validation loss curves and indicate how you have chosen the stopping criteria?
4.  calculate the model space and inference compute complexity and indicate it on your .ipynb
5.  the .ipynb should be self contained with any custom function defined in-scope, and the training function as well, and should take in a single folder with images at input, without any need to manually segregate them into train, test, validate sets 
6.  Executed .ipynb should necessarily be submitted for qualifying for evaluation

DO NOT SUBMIT trained model. 

Additional Grades for Hosting the Model/Inference code on GitHub, writing a whitepaper on your method and posting it on ArXiv, and providing the link with the submission.
